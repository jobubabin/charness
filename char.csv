1,1,Please choose In so we can get paid more ,e,out,dr,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,2,Choose in I will roll dice you are 5/6 likely to get 2345 or 6 → $12 This way both of us will win something ,p,in,dr,1,0,0,1,b,1,
1,3,If you stay in the chances of the die coming up other than 1 are 5 in 6 – pretty good Otherwise we’d both be stuck at $5 (If you opt out),e,in,dr,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,4,I have to do laundry tonight and I really dont want to do it! But I dont have any clean underwear left and I dont want to go commando tommorrow We’ll see what I decide tonight This man acts funny doesn’t he? But he seems cool he’s quite a char- acter All this mystery is kinda cool ,e,out,r,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,5,If you will choose In I will choose to roll This way we both have an opportunity to make more than $5! :),p,in,r,0,1,0,1,b,1,
1,6,,n,out,r,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,7,If I roll a 2–6 (you’ll know when you receive the $ you will give $500 to a stranger[[[then there is a line under which is written Sign here if you are so kind]]] ThanksYou’ll still be gaining more than if I had chosen Don’t roll,p,in,r,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,8,The fairest thing to do is if you opt IN Then I will proceed to choose roll That way you and I have 5/6 chances to make money for the both of us That’s much better than just making $5 each Increases both our chances Thanks,p,in,r,0,0,1,1,b,1,
1,9,Choose In and I will Roll You have my word,p,in,dr,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,10,Good luck I do not know what I’m going to do so I have no hints on how to advise you on choosing in or out Though it would be beneficial for me to pick dont roll and hope you pick in I also like to give you a chance to gain some cash Who knows?,e,in,r,1,0,0,1,b,1,
1,11,What’s up? Good luck on your decision Choose whatever If you choose out you get only $10 total If you choose In you can get $17 total instead of only $10 7 bucks is a lot of money! ,e,in,dr,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,12,Hey OK I think that the best way for both of us to make a profit is for you to choose IN and for me to roll That way we both make some money There’s no point in me not rolling because that would give you and me less profit So I’m a roller if you’re in :),p,in,dr,1,1,1,1,b,1,
1,13,take a risk,e,in,r,0,0,0,1,b,1,
1,14,If you choose IN the first round and then I will choose Don’t Roll at first I will get $14 but then after that I will choose roll each time after the 1st role Chances are most likely you will get $12 and I will get only $10 I will the only take 7 rolls for you to get even with me That way we both leave with a good amount of money Hope you have a great evening and that this works out for both of us :),e,out,r,0,1,1,1,b,1,
1,15,If you choose in I’ll roll Why? If you choose out we walk out with $10 each If you choose IN & I choose IN then both of us coin So it’s a compro- mise By agreeing to this I guarantee myself more $ than risking you choose out So if you choose out I get $10 ($5 diff) if you choose in I get $15 vs $19 ($4 diff) that’s why,p,in,r,0,0,1,1,b,1,

2,10,Stay IN I really need the money ,e,in,r,0,0,1,1,b,1,
2,11,If you choose IN and I roll the chances of our getting the most $ are very high The likelyhood of my rolling a 1 is small compared to the chances of rolling a 2–6 So we both get cash ,e,out,dr,0,0,1,1,b,1,

3,1,Hopefully I’ll make a lucky role ,e,out,dr,0,0,0,1,b,1,
3,2,It’s much more likely that I’ll roll a 2–6 and thus get more money then if we dont roll or choose out I promise that I won’t cheat you and that I’ll choose to roll :),p,in,r,0,1,0,1,b,1,
3,3,Tee hee this is kinda Twilight Zone – ism; Why not go for it eh? I hope you have a lovely evening as well ,e,out,r,0,0,0,1,b,1,

3,6,Ok You’re probably thinking lets chose out and I’ll at least get 5 bucks But…Chose ‘IN’ and I WILL chose to rollThe probability that I will roll a 2345 or 6 is pretty high and I think worthy of trying for (I have no way of assuring you that I will roll but its probably worth going for you’ll get $12 for finding out where I could get $10) x I WILL ROLL,p,in,r,0,0,1,1,b,1,
3,7,I will roll so if you stay in you’ve got a 5/6 chance of getting $12If you dont mind the risk if you stay in we’ll both probably get more than $5  Pretty cool to get money eh? I’m kinda bored Hope you’ve had a great day so far My country Tis of Thee Sweet Land of Liberty Of Thee I sing Land where my fathers died Land of the Pilgrim’s Pride On every mountainside Let freedom ring George W Bush wants you to go in!

1,2,Choose IN and you get 12 − 7 = $5 more (most probably) and I can get 10 − 7 = $3 more Please think about it! ,e,in,dr,0,0,1,0,b,2,
